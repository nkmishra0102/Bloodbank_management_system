1.What are the minimum requirements to become a blood donor?<br>
Check with your local blood bank to determine the specific requirements. You must be at least 16 years of age, a minimum of 110 pounds, and in basic good health.
<hr></p>
<p>
2.Will donating blood hurt?<br>
You might feel a slight sting in the beginning lasting only a couple of seconds, but there should be no discomfort during the donation.
<hr></p>
<p>
3.Are blood donors paid?<br>
No. Blood collected for transfusion in the US is collected from volunteer blood donors.
<hr></p>
<p>
4.How badly is blood needed?<br>

Blood supplies vary depending on the region and time of year. As more restrictive donor criteria are necessary to protect the safety of the blood supply and as the donor population ages, the inventory levels are affected across the nation. If you are eligible, your blood donations are needed. The inventory levels of blood would be more consistently maintained if more of those who are eligible donate 1-2 times each year.
<hr></p>
<p>
5.Why are there often blood shortages?<br>
Most blood centers strive to maintain an optimum inventory level of a three-day supply. Due to unpredictable demands for trauma patients, the inventory fluctuates hourly. When the blood supply drops below a three-day level, blood centers begin alerting local donors to increase the inventory to a safe operating level.
<hr></p>
<p>
6.Are sterile supplies used?<br>
Based on AABB Standards and FDA regulations, all needles, tubing sets, collection bags and other donation supplies are sterile, used once, and discarded in the trash to protect the donor, the transfusion recipient, and the blood donor center staff.
<hr></p>
<p>
7.How much blood is taken?<br>
For a whole blood donation, approximately 500 ml or one-half liter of blood is collected. For donations of other blood products, such as platelet or plasma, the amount collected depends on your height, weight and platelet count.
<hr></p>
<p>
8.How often may I donate?<br>
The Medical Director of each blood donor center is responsible for setting policies regarding the frequency of donation. The policies set by a Medical Director can be more restrictive, permitting donation less frequently than permitted by AABB Standards and FDA regulations. Based on AABB and FDA requirements, you must wait 56 days between whole blood donations. Platelet (apheresis) donors may donate more frequently. This is because the body replenishes platelets and plasma more quickly than red cells. Platelets will return to normal levels within about 72 hours of donating. Plasma (the liquid portion of your blood) will return to normal levels within a couple of days.
